                        Over a year ago, we embarked on a journey to create a platform specifically designed for campus residents in Nigeria to buy and sell online with ease. At that time, none of the existing e-commerce solutions offered the control and flexibility we needed to truly empower our communityâ€”so we decided to build our own. That&apos;s how Shopiva was born: a user-friendly, all-in-one solution that caters to sellers&apos; needs, from inventory management to secure transactions, giving them the freedom to focus on what they do best.

                        Today, Shopiva has grown beyond just serving campuses; it has become the go-to platform for businesses of all sizes. Whether you&apos;re an online seller, running a physical retail store, or making sales on-the-go, Shopiva equips you with powerful tools to manage, expand, and simplify your business. We&apos;re proud to support entrepreneurs across Nigeria as they build successful businesses on their own terms with Shopiva by their side.</p>
